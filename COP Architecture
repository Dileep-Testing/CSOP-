# System Architecture of CSOP Background Fund Management System

## Overview
The CSOP Background Fund Management System is designed to manage funds, track performance, analyze holdings, and store documents. It consists of several key modules that interact with each other to provide a seamless user experience.

## Key Components
- **Frontend**: The user interface where users can input data, view reports, and interact with the system.
  - Built with HTML, CSS, JavaScript (React or Angular can be used for better performance).
  
- **Backend**: The server-side application that handles business logic and interacts with the database.
  - Built using Python (Flask/Django) or Node.js (Express).
  - Responsible for managing user requests, processing data, and returning results.
  
- **Database**: A relational database (MySQL) stores all fund-related data, such as fund information, holdings, and performance metrics.
  - Data is organized into tables like `Funds`, `Holdings`, `Performance`, and `Distributions`.

- **External Integrations**: External services that provide data such as fund pricing, performance benchmarks, and external documents.
  - API integrations with third-party providers (Bloomberg, Reuters).

## Data Flow Diagram
1. **User Requests**: Users interact with the frontend UI.
2. **Frontend to Backend**: The UI sends requests (via HTTP/REST API calls) to the backend server.
3. **Backend Processing**: The backend fetches necessary data from the database or external APIs, processes the data, and returns the results.
4. **Data Storage**: The backend updates the database to store new or updated fund data, performance metrics, or document versions.
5. **External API Calls**: The system makes API calls to third-party services to fetch fund pricing and benchmarks.

## Database Schema
- **Funds**: Stores information about funds such as name, ticker, inception date, investment objective.
- **Holdings**: Stores information about the fund's holdings, including security name, weight, exposure, and value.
- **Performance**: Tracks performance metrics like TWR, Sharpe Ratio, and Sortino Ratio.
- **Documents**: Stores fund documents like prospectus, annual reports, and tax documents.

## Scalability
- **Load Balancing**: Use load balancers to distribute requests evenly across multiple servers for high availability.
- **Database Optimization**: Index key columns in the database for faster queries.
